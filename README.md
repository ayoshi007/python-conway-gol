# Conway's Game of Life in Python
An implementation of Conway's Game of Life in Python Tkinter.
## Overview
This is a pedagogical project with the learning goals of:
- using TOML-based Python build systems
- learning how TOML-based build systems differ from the legacy setup.py based build systems
- using unit-testing in Python
- exploring Conway's Game of Life

The project will be made with Python 3.10, as it is the latest stable version of Python at the time of the project's creation.
