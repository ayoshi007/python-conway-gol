# Conway's Game of Life in Python
An implementation of Conway's Game of Life in Python Tkinter.  
Made with Python 3.10

## Overview
This is a pedagogical project with the learning goals of:
- using TOML-based Python build systems
- learning how TOML-based build systems differ from the legacy setup.py based build systems
- using unit-testing in Python
- exploring Conway's Game of Life

**Note**: although this is an application and not a package, the TOML file specifies pytest options allowing pytest to use the app's modules
