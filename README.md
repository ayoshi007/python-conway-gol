# Conway's Game of Life in Python
An implementation of Conway's Game of Life in Python Tkinter.  
Made with Python 3.10  
The ultimate goal of this project is to create an executable runnable on Windows, MacOS, and Ubuntu/Linux using PyInstaller

## Overview
This is a pedagogical project with the learning goals of:
- using TOML-based Python build systems
- learning how TOML-based build systems differ from the legacy setup.py based build systems
- using unit-testing in Python
- exploring Conway's Game of Life
